# Alexander Ding's Personal Website

This repository hosts the source of [https://alexander-ding.github.io](https://alexander-ding.github.io), my personal website. It is modelled after [Kevin Fang's personal website](https://kevinzfang.com/) (thank you!) and built using React.js.

To deploy, simply push a commit to the `source` branch.
